## Shiny with meuse

This repository stores a shiny app that visualizes the meuse dataset. It will perform an IDW interpolation on the analytes reported in the meuse dataset and calculate the Mean Absolute Error of each surface for each set of algorithm input parameters.

This app can be seen on [shinyapps.io](https://jmt2080ad.shinyapps.io/meuse_shiny/).
